# NBA-statistics


The site is essentially a newsletter designed to promote NBA basketball through the providing of information on players, teams, media and news from around the nba.
Users will be able to see up to date league rankings for the season, search for up to date statistics from their favourite player and see media
from the latest games to be played. They will also have the ability to contact the service to request data for specific players as all current nba players are listed. The value to the user will be the gaining of information through searches, viewing media and related content around the nba
and contacting the service with specific feedback or requests. The value to the provider will be increased traffic and outreach to fans and potential fans,
, direct feedback and usable data on players favoured by users and an interactive site that is engaging to the user. 

##UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

The website is mainly designed for NBA fans who are looking for interesting content around the nba.


##Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
* Conference Standing section - this section uses the rapidAPI NBA API to provide up to date information on the standings for the season of each team in the Eastern and Western Conference.
* Video Section - section shows videos that boost engagement and shows interesting news from around the NBA. Weekly updates would be plays of the week from that week when the season is back on.
* News Section - with links to relevant news stories this section is interactive allowing users to show more content from the stories that interest them before following the link.
* Player Search - a search function using rapidAPI allows users to search any player in the NBA this season and get their averages for all the games they have played in their career and show up to date stats for that player. 
* Contact form - a contact form for users to email the site to request players they want information on. This could be past NBA stars not currently in the league.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

*JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

*Bootstrap
The project uses bootstrap to simplify html structure using the grid system and add styling using inbuilt css classes


##Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

###Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

##Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
